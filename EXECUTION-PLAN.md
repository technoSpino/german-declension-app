# EXECUTION PLAN

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step execution plan for building the German Declension Learning MVP.

---

## Prerequisites

### Tools Required
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Web browser (Chrome/Firefox for testing)
- Git (for version control)
- Terminal/Command line access

### Optional Tools
- Node.js & npm (for local development server)
- Netlify CLI (for deployment)
- Claude Code (for AI-assisted development)

---

## Execution Sequence

### Recommended: Sequential Approach

This approach ensures each module is complete and tested before moving to the next.

```
Week 1: Agent 1 (Table Module)
  ├── Days 1-2: Build table structure and data
  ├── Days 3-4: Add interactivity and modal
  ├── Day 5: Polish and test
  └── Day 6-7: Buffer for issues

Week 2: Agent 2 (Flashcard Module)
  ├── Days 1-2: Build card UI and Leitner system
  ├── Days 3-4: Add browse mode and stats
  ├── Day 5: Polish and test
  └── Day 6-7: Buffer for issues

Week 3: Agent 3 (Integration & Deployment)
  ├── Days 1-2: Create landing page and navigation
  ├── Days 3-4: Integrate modules and shared state
  ├── Day 5: Deploy to Netlify/GitHub Pages
  └── Day 6-7: Test and document
```

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup

```bash
# 1. Create project directory
mkdir german-declension-app
cd german-declension-app

# 2. Initialize git
git init

# 3. Create module directories
mkdir table-module
mkdir flashcard-module
mkdir app

# 4. Copy agent specs
cp ../AGENT-1-TABLE-MODULE.md table-module/
cp ../AGENT-2-FLASHCARD-MODULE.md flashcard-module/
cp ../AGENT-3-INTEGRATION-DEPLOY.md app/
```

---

### Phase 2: Agent 1 - Table Module

#### Step 1: Read the Spec
```bash
cd table-module
cat AGENT-1-TABLE-MODULE.md
# or open in your editor
```

#### Step 2: Create Initial File
```bash
touch index.html
```

#### Step 3: Build the Table
**Using Claude Code:**
```bash
# In table-module directory
claude-code "Build a German declension table according to AGENT-1-TABLE-MODULE.md spec"
```

**Or manually:**
1. Create HTML structure
2. Add the 5 table data objects
3. Implement table rendering function
4. Add CSS for color coding
5. Implement modal for examples
6. Add click handlers
7. Make responsive

#### Step 4: Test
Open `table-module/index.html` in browser and verify:
- [ ] All 5 tables render
- [ ] Colors are correct
- [ ] Clicking cells shows modal
- [ ] Modal closes properly
- [ ] Responsive on mobile (DevTools)

#### Step 5: Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Agent 1: Table Module"
```

---

### Phase 3: Agent 2 - Flashcard Module

#### Step 1: Read the Spec
```bash
cd flashcard-module
cat AGENT-2-FLASHCARD-MODULE.md
```

#### Step 2: Create Initial File
```bash
touch index.html
```

#### Step 3: Build the Flashcards
**Using Claude Code:**
```bash
claude-code "Build a flashcard system according to AGENT-2-FLASHCARD-MODULE.md spec"
```

**Or manually:**
1. Create HTML structure
2. Generate 50 flashcard objects
3. Implement Leitner system logic
4. Build study mode UI
5. Add localStorage persistence
6. Build browse mode
7. Add stats page
8. Make responsive

#### Step 4: Test
Open `flashcard-module/index.html` in browser and verify:
- [ ] Cards display in study mode
- [ ] Answer buttons work
- [ ] Progress saves (check localStorage in DevTools)
- [ ] Browse mode shows cards
- [ ] Stats calculate correctly
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

#### Step 5: Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Agent 2: Flashcard Module"
```

---

### Phase 4: Agent 3 - Integration & Deployment

#### Step 1: Read the Spec
```bash
cd app
cat AGENT-3-INTEGRATION-DEPLOY.md
```

#### Step 2: Copy Modules to App
```bash
cp ../table-module/index.html table.html
cp ../flashcard-module/index.html flashcards.html
```

#### Step 3: Build Integration
**Using Claude Code:**
```bash
claude-code "Integrate modules according to AGENT-3-INTEGRATION-DEPLOY.md spec"
```

**Or manually:**
1. Create landing page (index.html)
2. Create shared navigation component
3. Create shared styles.css
4. Create app.js for shared state
5. Add cross-module links
6. Test navigation flow
7. Implement progress tracking

#### Step 4: Test Integration
```bash
# Start local server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve app
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and verify:
- [ ] Landing page loads
- [ ] Navigate to tables
- [ ] Navigate to flashcards
- [ ] Navigate back to home
- [ ] Progress updates
- [ ] Cross-module links work

#### Step 5: Deploy to Netlify

**Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the `app/` folder
3. Done! Note the URL

**Option B: CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
cd app/
netlify deploy --prod
```

**Option C: Git Integration**
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin main

# Connect in Netlify dashboard
# Site → New site from Git → Select repo
# Build settings: publish directory = "app"
```

#### Step 6: Post-Deployment Test
Visit your deployed URL and verify:
- [ ] All pages accessible
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Study session completes
- [ ] Progress saves
- [ ] Works on mobile (test on real device)

#### Step 7: Final Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Agent 3: Integration and Deployment"
git push
```

## Alternative: Parallel Execution

If you have multiple developers or AI instances:

### Developer 1: Agent 1 (Table Module)
- Work independently in `table-module/`
- Complete and test fully
- Commit when done

### Developer 2: Agent 2 (Flashcard Module)
- Work independently in `flashcard-module/`
- Complete and test fully
- Commit when done

### Developer 3: Agent 3 (Integration)
- Wait for Agents 1 & 2 to complete
- Copy their completed files
- Integrate and deploy

**Timeline:** Potentially complete in 1 week if parallel

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Table not rendering
```
Check:
1. JavaScript console for errors
2. Data structure matches spec
3. CSS is loading
4. Functions are defined before use
```

### Issue: Flashcards not saving
```
Check:
1. localStorage is enabled in browser
2. saveProgress() is called after each answer
3. JSON.stringify/parse works (check for circular refs)
4. Check browser console for quota errors
```

### Issue: Navigation broken
```
Check:
1. File paths are correct (case-sensitive on Linux)
2. All HTML files are in correct location
3. Links use relative paths
4. Test in local server, not file://
```

### Issue: Deployment fails
```
Netlify:
1. Check netlify.toml is in root
2. Verify publish directory is "app"
3. Check build logs for errors

GitHub Pages:
1. Verify gh-pages branch exists
2. Check Settings → Pages is enabled
3. Wait 5 minutes for propagation
```

## Next Steps After MVP

### Week 4: Polish & Feedback
1. Share with 5 A2 German learners
2. Collect feedback
3. Fix bugs
4. Add most-requested features

### Week 5+: Iterate
Based on feedback, consider:
- Dark mode
- Export progress
- More cards (100 total)
- Audio pronunciation
- Pattern highlighting in tables
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Achievement system

### Future (V2):
- 3D room module
- Advanced analytics
- Cloud sync
- Community features
- Mobile app

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Test Early, Test Often
Don't wait until the end. Test each feature as you build it.

### 2. Use Version Control
Commit after each major feature. Makes it easy to revert if needed.

### 3. Start Simple
Get the basic version working, then add polish.

### 4. Mobile First
Test on mobile early. It's easier to scale up than down.

### 5. Keep Scope Tight
Resist feature creep. Ship the MVP, then iterate.

### 6. Document as You Go
Write README and comments while building, not at the end.

### 7. Get Feedback Early
Share with users as soon as it's functional, even if rough.
