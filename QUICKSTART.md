## For Developers (Using Claude Code)

### Option 1: Sequential Execution (Recommended for Solo)

```bash
# 1. Extract the zip
unzip german-declension-mvp.zip
cd german-declension-mvp

# 2. Week 1: Build Table Module
cd agent-1-table
cat SPEC.md
# Use Claude Code to build table module

# 3. Week 2: Build Flashcard Module
cd ../agent-2-flashcard
cat SPEC.md
# Use Claude Code to build flashcard module

# 4. Week 3: Integration & Deploy
cd ../agent-3-integration

```

### Option 2: Parallel Execution (Team)

```bash
# Developer 1
cd agent-1-table
